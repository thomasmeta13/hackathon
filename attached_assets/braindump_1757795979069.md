🌺 HTW Earn Hub — AI + Human Task Platform 🎯 Overview HTW Earn Hub is a gamified platform where the Honolulu Tech Week (HTW) team, event hosts, and community members collaborate through AI-assisted task creation and human-powered execution. It solves HTW’s biggest challenges: onboarding event hosts, generating creative growth marketing, and mobilizing the community to contribute with clear incentives. 👩‍💼 Task Inventor Side (HTW Organizers & Hosts) Monitor & Identify Needs “We’re missing promo videos.” “This event host hasn’t submitted a flyer.” “We need a social media buzz moment.” AI-Human Task Creation Admin logs in, describes the issue to a chatbot interface. AI proposes potential tasks (e.g. “Create TikTok memes,” “Submit event checklist,” “Fix bug on site”). Admin iterates with chatbot, approves the final bounty. Growth Marketing Tool Integrated module where organizers and hosts can brainstorm with AI: “What’s our Studio Ghibli moment?” “How do we make this event go viral on Twitter?” Outputs ready-to-post campaigns, which can be turned into bounties for the community to execute. Event Host Planning & Onboarding Hosts guided through a questline: Submit event description. Upload marketing flyer. Confirm venue. Share recap after event. Each step framed as a task, with AI templates + feedback loops to make hosting easy. Distribution Once a task is live, it can auto-generate shareable cards for Slack, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, or the HTW site. 👨‍🎤 Tasker Side (Attendees & Contributors) Profile & Skills Create profile, set skills (design, dev, marketing, hosting). Take quick skill test → earn rating (Novice / Skilled / Expert). Quest Feed Gamified interface shows task cards: Title: “Design a flyer for Tech + Surf event 🌊.” Reward: $50 + 50 XP.
