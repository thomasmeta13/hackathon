# App Functionalities

## User & JTBD
- **Primary Users**: HTW organizers, event hosts, and community members.
- **JTBD**: When organizing and promoting events, HTW organizers and hosts need a streamlined platform to create and distribute tasks, while community members require a gamified interface to complete tasks. Both sides should leverage AI-driven interactions to efficiently onboard hosts, generate creative marketing content, and mobilize community contributions, ensuring successful and vibrant events.

## Core Flows
1. **Task Creation & Distribution**:
   - Organizers use the AI interface to create tasks, iterate on details, and distribute them across channels.
   - Tasks can be shared via Slack, Discord, Twitter, etc.

2. **Task Completion & Interaction**:
   - Taskers browse the Quest/Task List, select tasks, and use the AI interface to complete them.
   - AI provides guidance and feedback, ensuring taskers can efficiently complete tasks.

3. **Profile Management & Progress Tracking**:
   - Taskers manage their profiles, update skills, and track progress through XP, badges, and leaderboards.
   - Organizers view network health metrics to assess community engagement and impact.
