### 3-Push Build Plan

**Push 1: Core Infrastructure & Task Creation**
- **Objective**: Establish the foundational elements of the platform, focusing on task creation and distribution.
- **Components**:
  - Set up the database with Task, User, and Organization entities.
  - Implement the Organizer Dashboard with network health insights.
  - Develop the AI-assisted Task Creation Interface for organizers.
  - Integrate external API (OpenAI) for AI-driven task suggestions.
- **Acceptance Check**: Ensure organizers can create and distribute tasks seamlessly, with AI providing actionable insights and structured plans.
- **Why**: This push establishes the core functionality needed for organizers to efficiently manage tasks, setting the stage for community engagement.

**Push 2: Task Completion & User Interaction**
- **Objective**: Build the task completion experience for taskers, focusing on AI-human interaction.
- **Components**:
  - Develop the Quest/Task List interface for taskers.
  - Implement specific AI/Human Interaction Screens for different task types (e.g., video generation, coding).
  - Enable taskers to interact with AI for task guidance and completion.
  - Set up Profile & Skills management for taskers.
- **Acceptance Check**: Taskers can browse, select, and complete tasks using AI guidance, with progress tracked in their profiles.
- **Why**: This push enhances the user experience for taskers, making task completion engaging and rewarding, which is crucial for community participation.

**Push 3: Community Engagement & Monitoring**
- **Objective**: Finalize the platform with features that boost community engagement and provide comprehensive monitoring tools.
- **Components**:
  - Implement the Network Health Dashboard for organizers to track engagement and task completion rates.
  - Develop leaderboards and progress bars to motivate taskers.
  - Integrate social sharing features for task distribution.
  - Conduct usability testing and refine the user interface based on feedback.
- **Acceptance Check**: Organizers can monitor community health, and taskers are motivated by visible progress and rewards.
- **Why**: This push ensures the platform is not only functional but also engaging and effective in mobilizing the community, aligning with the hackathon's goals.
